# rtTemplater
RT-templater is web app to create templates of reusable code that can dynamically build extra code based on fewer inputs, using your catalogue of template that you build using it...
in other words, write boilerplate once to reuse in new projects, for faster project startups when you need to add pieces of a puzzle without copying an entire saved template project that may not be suited for your needs.
